### Hey, I'm Sabina (she/her/hers)! 👋🏻

I am a graduate student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics/index.php) in the Department of Physics & Astronomy, but I mostly do *Physics* :books::pencil2: in *Astronomy* 🪐:milky_way::telescope:! I work with a lot of amazing people to understand planet formation, accretion disks and things in them, and stellar variability. I enjoy doing 👩🏻‍💻 (simulations and data analysis).
